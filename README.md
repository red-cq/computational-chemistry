# Research

## Overview
This repository contains code implementing **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations** for a molecular physics problem. The approach utilizes **simulated annealing** combined with an MCMC method similar to **Metropolis-Hastings** to optimize and explore the system efficiently.

## Features
- Implements **Metropolis-Hastings**-style MCMC sampling
- Uses **simulated annealing** to refine solutions
- Models molecular interactions based on stochastic processes
- Fully modular and extensible codebase for experimentation

You can customize sections further to match your specific implementation. Let me know if youâ€™d like adjustments or additions! ðŸš€
